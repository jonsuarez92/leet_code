difference between var and let/constis what we call scope.

ans:
Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.

Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.

Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.

They all have Global Scope.

In JavaScript, objects and functions are also variables.
