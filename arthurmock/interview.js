1.JavaScript Data Types

primitive data types

2.Difference Between Const Let and Var

ans: 
difference between var and let/constis what we call scope.
var has function scope known as local scope and let and const
have limited block scope. block scope reduces the chance of accidentally
changing the variable value!!!! let you can change variale can be re-assigned while const can't

4. '',"",`` - empty string falsey
5. null - absence of any value
6. undefined
7. NaN - not a number


6.Global Variables

ans: 
Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.

Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.

Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.

They all have Global Scope.

In JavaScript, objects and functions are also variables.
